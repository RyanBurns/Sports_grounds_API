My API to be used with a public sports grounds dataset in Galway
May be found at *https://data.gov.ie/data* 
Specifically at *https://data.gov.ie/dataset/galway-city-public-sports-facilities/*

The Public Sports grounds in Galway City dataset contains information about all of the sports facilities around the city.
Information such as the parks name, location, opening hours, type of grounds: Rugby/Football/G.A.A.
This dataset could be used well with a mobile app, for users looking to find the closest public facilities.

## List of Rugby Grounds in Galway City
You can get a list of Rugby grounds in Galway City using the GET method at the following URL:
*http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/[all]*

##Using the Datset
#Return all sports facilities

Using the HTTP POST method, you can display a list of all the facilities/sports grounds in Galway City:
*http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/[all]*

The data will be returned in JSON format,  here is the first line of the file in JSON format, this should illustrate how the data is displayed:

#Getting A List of Sports Facilities Nearby

If you want to get the users location data to search for sports facilities close to them. You use the longitude and latitude, with a POST method, using the following URL:

http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/closest-long-lat/

This will display all of the sports facilities, begining with the sportsground that is closest to the longitude and latitude co-ordinates provided.

#To filter results returned by the POST method.
This can be done using the following URL:

http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/nearby-long-lat/[number]

Replace [number] with the number of sports grounds you want to be given back. This again will display all sports facilities nearby except this time it will only return the desired amount, and will list them in order of proximity.

Limiting the number of results returned back would look like this:

http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/nearby-long-lat/3

This returns the 3 closest parks to the longitude and latitude used in the POST method.

#If you simply wanted a list of facilities based on certain search parameter
such as "Rugby" or "Soccer" then you would use the HTTP GET method, here is an example URL:

http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/?[filter]=[parameter]

Replace [filter] with a datset field entry, examples: Number, name, longitude, objectid.

Also Replace [parameter] with the required results, like this:

http://galwaysportsfacilitiesapi.com/sports/?TYPE=All+Weather+Pitch

The above URL would return a list of all "All Weather Pitches" in Galway City, perfect if your favourite training is water-logged and unusable


##Conclusion
This API would be useful if somebody made an application for sports people around Galway, my imagined user is somebody who wants to know which sportsgrounds are open to public use, and what facilities are there : G.A.A / Soccer / Both.
